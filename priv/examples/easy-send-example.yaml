where: RAD
why: |
  Bloodmoney API key and base URL are hard-coded in frontend code (searchHits.ts), shipping in every bundle.
  Anyone inspecting DevTools or built assets can extract the key and bypass authentication, defeating the worker proxy protection.
what: |
  - [ ] Move API_BASE_URL and API_KEY to backend/worker
  - [ ] Create /api/bloodmoney/* endpoints in worker
  - [ ] Update fetchSearchHits to call worker endpoint instead of direct API
  - [ ] Remove hard-coded credentials from searchHits.ts
  - [ ] Verify bundle no longer contains sensitive data
